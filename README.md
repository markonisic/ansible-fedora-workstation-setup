## Personal Fedora workstation initial setup

- Ansible playbook to do the initial setup of the new desktop computer/laptop
running Fedora. Intended for automating the tasks such as installing packages, personal configuration
and to ease up the migration process when switching to a new computer(and act as a "backup", in a way in order
to speed up the process if the worst comes).

~~- [x] Add task to change default shell~~

~~- [x] Add Flatpak packages~~

~~-[x] Add task to check and skip install if ZSH, OhMyZSH and Powerlevel10k installs exists~~

- [ ] Add autoremove
